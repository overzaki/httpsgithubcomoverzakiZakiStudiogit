# Design Requirements Needed

To build the AI media marketplace exactly as you envision, I need:

## 1. Design References
- Figma design files or screenshots
- Reference images showing the exact layout you want
- Color palette and typography specifications

## 2. Page-by-Page Requirements
Please specify for each page:

### Home Page
- Exact layout and components needed
- Header design and navigation style
- Product showcase format
- Category selection interface
- AI generation interface

### Search/Browse Page
- Filter and search interface
- Grid/list view options
- Asset preview cards design

### AI Generation Page
- Input interface for prompts
- Generation progress indicators
- Result display format

### User Authentication
- Login/signup form design
- Social login options
- Password reset flow

### User Dashboard
- Profile management interface
- Download history
- Credit/subscription management

### Plans/Pricing Page
- Subscription tier display
- Payment interface
- Feature comparison

## 3. Specific Features to Focus On
- Which features are highest priority?
- Any specific functionality requirements?
- Integration preferences (payment, AI APIs, etc.)

## Next Steps
Once you provide the design references, I'll rebuild each page methodically to match your exact specifications.
